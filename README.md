This repository is used to build documentation for installing, configuring, and playing *Myth II: Soulblighter* on the Steam Deck.

Currently it is a work in progress! The resulting documentation is not published anywhere yet.

When completed it will go hand-in-hand with a community input configuration for the game, named MythDeck, which is also not yet published.
