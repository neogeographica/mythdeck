This repository is used to build documentation for installing, configuring, and playing *Myth II: Soulblighter* on the Steam Deck.

You can see the resulting documentation online at [tinyurl.com/mythdeck](https://tinyurl.com/mythdeck).

These docs go hand-in-hand with a community input configuration for the game, named MythDeck.
