Reconfiguration
===============

The MythDeck config uses almost every :strike:`part of the buffalo` control on the Deck, but of course it's still possible to shuffle some things around if you want. For example if you play a lot of mods that use unit inventory, you may not want the inventory action to be squirreled away on that virtual menu, and you'd rather have it on some more immediately accessible button.

It's perfectly OK to change some stuff, just be careful about changing assignments for modifier keys... in most cases it's best to have a modifier-key control do the same thing regardless of whether a mode shift is active.

Also FYI there are still quite a few Myth input keys that I didn't bind to anything on the Deck. A somewhat-complete list of unbound stuff and why it is unbound:

* Y/Shift-Y to initiate team or global text chat. If you really need to text-chat then you're going to be typing on a (real or virtual) keyboard anyway and can hit the Y key there.
* F3/F4 for volume control. You can use the Deck's volume controls instead.
* F5 for autocam. Doesn't work in singleplayer and isn't very good anyway.
* F6/Shift-F6 and PgUp for in-game toggling of status bar, control bar, and detail textures. You can set these things in Myth preferences.
* Home/End to move the cursor in text fields. Might as well just click.
* Shift-Backspace to toggle an in-game FPS counter. You can use the Deck's.
* Ctrl-Plus/Minus to auto-win/lose a mission. This might be kinda nice for some folks to have? Not sure where to bind it though.

If something there sounds really useful then maybe there's an existing binding you can sacrifice to swap it in.
