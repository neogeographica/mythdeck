Myth: TFL
=========

If you installed the plugin "The Fallen Levels v2" as mentioned on the :doc:`Installation<../myth_setup/installation>` page, you can play the campaign for Myth: The Fallen Lords too. A couple of notes here about that.

Playing the Tutorial
--------------------

The TFL tutorial is a good place to start, and running it will also show you the original Myth: TFL intro video. But the tutorial is separate from the campaign and somewhat hard to find.

Do *not* click on "Tutorial" from the main menu. That's the Myth 2 tutorial. Instead:

* After launching Myth 2, click on "New Game".
* In the Campaign box on the next screen, one of the list items should be "Magma - The Fallen Levels v2". It may or may not already be selected... regardless, **shift-click** on it now using L4 + R2.
* The shift-click will make a mission called "Training Map" appear at the top of the Level list, in the upper-left of the screen. Click on that mission to select it.
* Select a difficulty in the upper right. This won't affect the tutorial, but will affect the following "real" missions.
* Finally, click the "TFL Gameplay" checkbox below the Campaign box.
* Now you can click on the "OK" button in the lower-right to launch into the tutorial.

Running the Campaign
--------------------

After playing the tutorial you will roll right into the first mission of the TFL campaign. If however you want to come back at some later time and play the first mission, then you will need to launch the New Game dialog and select the mission named "Crow's Bridge". If you don't see that mission in the list of unlocked missions on the left side of the dialog, then you probably don't have the "Magma - The Fallen Levels v2" campaign selected.

Don't forget to set your desired difficulty, and to make sure that the "TFL Gameplay" box is checked before launching any mission from the TFL campaign!
