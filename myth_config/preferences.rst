Preferences
===========

Let's start up Myth 2 and make sure the preferences are set up OK. As mentioned at the bottom of the :doc:`Installation<installation>` page, once you have selected the MythDeck configuration you can use its controls to mouse around the Myth 2 menus and change things as necessary:

  |rtrack| to move the cursor.

  |r2| or click |rtrack| to do a mouseclick.

So, open the Preferences menu. The image below shows some things to observe or change there:

In the box marked **1** you can see the current version of the Project Magma patch that you're running. As mentioned before, you need to be using 1.8.3 or later.

In the box marked **2** I've disabled the "control bar", which is a piece of UI at the bottom of the screen that can be used to mouse-select unit presets and formations. Using dedicated buttons on the Deck is faster and saves precious screen real estate.

In the box marked **3**, note that I've enabled persistent camera zoom. I always just want to leave the camera at max zoom anyway, so this way I don't have to fix it at the start of every mission. I also left persistent formations enabled; I tend to keep the same formation for a given group of units, and not having to re-select it all the time is very nice.

And finally, as noted in **4**, you can change the resolution if you like. Running at lower resolutions has the advantage of making enemy "dots" more visible on the overhead map, but at the expense of image quality. Try different resolutions to see what you like, but note that the native Deck screen resolution maxes out at 1280x800.

Next, click on the "Controls" button...
