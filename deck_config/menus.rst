Menus

Main Controls
-------------

For any menus that expect you to use a mouse:

  |rtrack| to move the cursor.

  |r2| or click |rtrack| to do a left mouseclick.

And specifically while in-game:

  |menu| to bring up or dismiss the pause menu.

Other Controls
--------------

Some less-common in-game menus don't expect mouse control, but rather want you to type a number from 0 to 9. This will be covered further on the :doc:`Other Stuff<other_stuff>` page, but the bottom line if you are faced with one of those menus:

  |ltrack| to bring up a number wheel menu; click the pad to select a number.

Doing competitive multiplayer with Steam Deck controls seems like an unlikely challenge for anyone to take on, but if you do here's an FYI about the unit trading menu:

  |l4| |plus| |r2| (i.e. shift click) to make clicks on up/down arrows immediately max out or zero out that unit count.

  |r5| |plus| |r2| (i.e. alt click) to make those clicks move the count by increments of 5. Note: this behavior is available in version 1.8.4 or later of the Project Magma patch.
