Unit Actions
============

Main Controls
-------------

When a Myth unit finishes with some order, it falls into a default "stance" (set of behaviors). In this stance it keeps its position if no hostile units are nearby. If it detects a hostile unit however it will attack, chasing if necessary.

If you want to put selected units into a different stance you can use the face buttons:

  |aface| for **Stop** to halt any movement of selected units and prevent them from attacking unless and until they are attacked. Attacked units will fight back; for ranged units this can include movement to try to open up enough distance to fire back.

  |bface| for **Retreat** to instruct selected units to run away from any nearby hostile.

  |xface| for **Guard**/**Hold** is similar to Stop, with the exception that ranged units are free to open fire on any enemies they detect (but they still will not chase).

  |yface| for **Scatter** to instruct selected units to run away from the center of their group, for a short distance. After the Scatter is complete, the units go back to the default stance.

Giving a unit some attack or move order will break its stance, and it will return to the default stance when the order is done.

Other Controls

  |l2| |plus| |xface| double-tap to rename selected units. Double-tap is required here to avoid entering the rename action's text entry box by accident. You would then need to open the virtual keyboard (Steam button + X) to type the new name.
