Interface
=========

Some controls are available to modify your in-game interface. All of these should be pretty rarely used; there's no clear division between "main controls" and "other".

Chat History
------------

Even in singleplayer, "chat" can be of interest as it is used for the text subtitles for a few of the in-game cutscenes. Normally chat messages are only shown for a short time, but you can look at a history of recent chat messages if you need to:

  |l2| |plus| |yface| to show chat history while this combo is held.

  |l4| |plus| |l2| |plus| |yface| to toggle the chat history display on/off.

Overhead Map
------------

I basically always leave the overhead map enabled, but you may want to turn it off if for some reason you really need to see or click on units/landscape that the map is obscuring.

  |lstickclick| to toggle the overhead map on/off.

In multiplayer, dots on the map can be shown either using team colors, or with a friend/foe color scheme where your units=green, allies=blue, enemies=red.

  |l2| |plus| |lstickclick| to toggle the overhead map dots color scheme (in multiplayer).

Finally, you can resize the overhead map. If you are playing at a larger-than-original screen resolution, you probably should.

  |rtrack| to move the cursor onto the overhead map, then

  |l4| |plus| |r2| to click and drag the map to the desired size, or

  |l4| |plus| |r1| to reset the map to its original size.

Capslock and Stats
------------------

  |rstickclick| to toggle the display of whatever info you chose to associate with the capslock key in the Myth control preferences.

  |l2| |plus| |menu| to show some player stats while this combo is held.

  |l4| |plus| |l2| |plus| |menu| to toggle the player stats display on/off.

Cutscenes
---------

The Myth pregame narrations and animated cutscenes are quite nice, but hey maybe you've seen them a lot.

  |l1| to skip a narration or cutscene.

  |r2| double-click will also skip.
